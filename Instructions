Step 1: Determine Your System Architecture
Windows 10:

Right-click on the Start button, click on 'System,' and look for 'System type.'
Windows 11:

Right-click on the Start button, click on 'Settings,' then 'System,' then 'About,' and look for 'System type.'
macOS:

Click the Apple menu, select "About This Mac," and look for the "Processor" or "Chip" information.
Step 2: Install Python
Windows/Mac:

Download and install Python from python.org, and ensure "Add Python to PATH" is checked.
Step 3: Install Required Libraries
Windows/Mac:

Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac), and run: pip install python-chess.
Step 4: Download Chess Engines
Windows/Mac:

Stockfish: Download from the official website.
LC0: Download from the official GitHub page and the weights file.
Komodo: Download from the official website.
Step 5: Prepare the Code
Windows/Mac:

Create a Python file and paste the provided code.
Modify paths to the Stockfish, LC0, and Komodo executables and the LC0 weights file. For example:
Stockfish (Windows): 'Stockfish': chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(r"C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads\stockfish\stockfish.exe")
LC0 (Mac): 'LC0': chess.engine.SimpleEngine.popen_uci(r"/Users/YourUsername/Downloads/lc0-v0.30.0-macos-cpu-openblas/lc0")
LC0 weights file: engines['LC0'].configure({'WeightsFile': r'/Users/YourUsername/Downloads/lc0-v0.30.0-macos-cpu-openblas/weights_run1_814631.lc0'})
Save the file with a .py extension, like chess_game.py.
Step 6: Run the Code
Windows:

Navigate to the directory where the file is saved (e.g., cd C:\Users\YourUsername\Downloads).
Run: python chess_game.py.
macOS:

Navigate to the directory where the file is saved (e.g., cd /Users/YourUsername/Downloads).
Run: python3 chess_game.py.
Step 7: Follow the On-Screen Instructions
Windows/Mac:

The program will guide you through playing, watching, or analyzing chess games.
Note
Ensure that all paths in the code are correctly specified.
Ensure that you have downloaded the correct versions of the engines and weights file that match your system architecture.
By following these instructions, you can set up and run the chess analysis program on both Windows and macOS systems. Enjoy playing and analyzing chess!
